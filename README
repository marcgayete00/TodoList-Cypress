QA Challenge for intern candidates
For the creation of this challenge, I decided to develop a simple Todo List project with few functionalities. 
Users will be able to add tasks, mark them as completed and delete tasks. 

Use case 1: Add task
User introduce a task name 
User clicks the button with the "+" symbol to add the task
The task is displayed in the task list and complete and delete options appear

Use case 2: Complete task
Once the user has previusly completed all steps from "Use case 1"
User clicks complete button
The task change it's style adding a slash in the task's name which indicates a completed task 

Use case 3
Once the user has previusly completed all steps from "Use case 1"
Users clicks delete button
The tasks is deleted from the task list

To perform all automation test cases I decided to use Cypress, I installed the program locally. 
Due the fact that the project is very reduced I decided to automate all test cases.
Even though I havenâ€™t used Cypress before I am positive about having completed the task successfully.
